Professor X wants his students to help each other in the chemistry lab. He suggests that every student should help out a classmate who scored less marks than him in chemistry and whose roll number appears after him. But the students are lazy and they don't want to search too far. They each pick the first roll number after them that fits the criteria. Find the marks of the classmate that each student picks.
Note: one student may be selected by multiple classmates.

Example 1:

Input: N = 5, arr[] = {3, 8, 5, 2, 25}
Output: 2 5 2 -1 -1
Explanation: 
1. Roll number 1 has 3 marks. The first person 
who has less marks than him is roll number 4, 
who has 2 marks.
2. Roll number 2 has 8 marks, he helps student 
with 5 marks.
3. Roll number 3 has 5 marks, he helps student 
with 2 marks.
4. Roll number 4 and 5 can not pick anyone as 
no student with higher roll number has lesser 
marks than them. This is denoted by -1.
Output shows the marks of the weaker student that 
each roll number helps in order. ie- 2,5,2,-1,-1

In the game of Restricted Pacman, an infinite linear path is given. Pacman has to start at position 0 and eat as many candies as possible. In one move he can only jump a distance of either M or N.  If M and N are coprime numbers, find how many candies will be left on the board after the game is over.
Note: The result is always finite as after a point X every index in the infinite path can be visited. 

Example 1:

Input: M = 2, N = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: From index 0, the indices that 
can be visited are
0 + 2 = 2
0 + 2 + 2 = 4
0 + 5 = 5
0 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
0 + 2 + 5 = 7
0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
0 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 9
0 + 5 + 5 = 10
and so on.
1 and 3 are the only indices that cannot be 
visited. Therefore the candies at these two 
positions will be left on the board.

            /   \         /  \
           8     19     20    11
          /     /  \
         30   40   50
target = 9, K = 1
Output:
22
Explanation:
Nodes within distance 1 from 9 are 9, 5, 7, 1

Lucy lives in house number X. She has a list of N house numbers in the society. Distance between houses can be determined by studying the difference between house numbers. Help her find out K closest neighbors.
Note: If two houses are equidistant and Lucy has to pick only one, the house with the smaller house number is given preference.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5, X = 0, K = 4
a[] = {-21, 21, 4, -12, 20}, 
Output:
-21 -12 4 20
Explanation:
The closest neighbour is house
number 4. Followed by -12 and 20. -21 and 21 
are both equal distance from X=0. Therefore, 
Lucy can only pick 1. Based on the given 
condition she picks -21 as it is the smaller 
of the two.
