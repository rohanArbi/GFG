Given a positive integer N. You have to find Nth natural number after removing all the numbers containing digit 9 .


Input:
N = 9
Output:
10
Explanation:
After removing natural numbers which contains
digit 9, first 9 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10
and 9th number is 10.




3.Given an array of size N, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of some elements from the array.


Input: 
N = 6
array[] = {1, 10, 3, 11, 6, 15}
Output: 
2
Explanation:
2 is the smallest integer value that cannot 
be represented as sum of elements from the array.


A drawer contains socks of n different colours. The number of socks available of ith colour is given by a[i] where a is an array of n elements. Tony wants to take k pairs of socks out of the drawer. However, he cannot see the colour of the sock that he is picking. You have to tell what is the minimum number of socks Tony has to pick in one attempt from the drawer such that he can be absolutely sure, without seeing their colours, that he will have at least k matching pairs.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4, K = 6
a[] = {3, 4, 5, 3}
Output: 15
Explanation: 
All 15 socks have to be picked in order
to obtain 6 pairs.

Given a matrix of size N x M. You have to find the Kth element which will obtain while traversing the matrix spirally starting from the top-left corner of the matrix.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 3, M = 3, K = 4
A[] = {{1, 2, 3}, 
       {4, 5, 6}, 
       {7, 8, 9}}
Output: 
6
Explanation: Spiral traversal of matrix: 
{1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5}. Fourth element
is 6.

In Geekland there is a grid of coins of size N x N. You have to find the maximum sum of coins in any sub-grid of size K x K.
Note: Coins of the negative denomination are also possible at Geekland.

Example 1:

Input: N = 5, K = 3 
mat[[]] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1} 
          {2, 2, 2, 2, 2} 
          {3, 8, 6, 7, 3} 
          {4, 4, 4, 4, 4} 
          {5, 5, 5, 5, 5}
Output: 48
Explanation: {8, 6, 7}
             {4, 4, 4}
             {5, 5, 5}
has the maximum sum




Given an array of size N, find the number of distinct pairs {a[i], a[j]} (i != j) in the array with their sum greater than 0.

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, a[] = {3, -2, 1}
Output: 2
Explanation: {3, -2}, {3, 1} are two 
possible pairs. 


Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B becomes a substring of the repeated A. If B cannot be a substring of A no matter how many times it is repeated, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: A = "abcd", B = "cdabcdab"
Output: 3
Explanation: After repeating A three times, 
we get "abcdabcdabcd".
